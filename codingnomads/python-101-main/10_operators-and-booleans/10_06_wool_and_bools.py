# Write a code snippet that gives a name to a `sheep`
# and uses a boolean value to define whether it has `wool` or not.

# Assign a name to the sheep
sheep_name = "Dolly"

# Define whether the sheep has wool or not
has_wool = True

# Output the sheep's details
print(f"The sheep's name is {sheep_name} and it {'has' if has_wool else 'does not have'} wool.")
