# Write code to display the area and perimeter
# of a rectangle that has a width of 2.4 and a height of 6.4.

# Define the width and height of the rectangle
width = 2.4
height = 6.4

# Calculate the area of the rectangle
area = width * height

# Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
perimeter = 2 * (width + height)

# Print the area and perimeter
print("Area of the rectangle:", area)
print("Perimeter of the rectangle:", perimeter)
