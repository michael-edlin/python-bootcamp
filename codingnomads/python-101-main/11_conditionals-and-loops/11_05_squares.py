# Write a script that prints out all the squares of numbers from 1 to 50.
# Use a `for` loop that demonstrates the use of the `range()` function.

# Loop through numbers 1 to 50
for number in range(1, 51):
    # Calculate the square of the number
    square = number ** 2
    # Print the square
    print(f"The square of {number} is {square}")
